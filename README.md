# 3D-heat-transport


both .py files are commented.

if one needs to simulate solid material heating (temperature distribution), then one can use this code.


while 4d plotting you should be able to distinguish copper radiator and surrounding water after at least 2 seconds of simulated time


the aim is to determine TDPs of different fin geometries

Performance: this is not efficient code. for ryzen 7 5800x 1 s of simulation takes 20 mins (now)
